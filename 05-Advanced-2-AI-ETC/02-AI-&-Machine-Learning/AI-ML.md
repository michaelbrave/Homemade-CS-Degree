Things to Look up, Terms I read somewhere, Things that seem worth defining and writing down, and then understanding at a deeper level / especially in context of generating content:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Deep Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    - mostly used for time-dependent sequential data (e.g., action sequences, agent paths, charts for rhythm)
    - Contextual Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (C-BLSTM)
- Deep Learning - defined as neural networks with at least two layers and some nonlinearity
- Reinforcement Learning
- Transformers (like GPT-3)
- Language Models
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    - good for images
- Supervised Learning (SL)
    - used as a predictor or quality evaluator or preference screener
- Unsupervised Learning (USL)
- Autoencoders
    - Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
        - NPC role classifier
    - Gaussian Mixture VAE
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    - communication systems
- Knowledge Graph
- stochastic bi-objective beam search model
    - to identify emotion
- Markov Decision Process (MDP)
    - strategy based deck building
- Fractal network (convo-lutional network with structured skip connections)
- Adversarial Learning (AL)
    - good with 2D arrays like images or sprite tiles
- Conditional Embedding Self-Attention GAN (CESAGAN)
- deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
    - was used to make 2D heightmaps
-  token-based oneshot arbitrary dimension generative adversarial network (TOAD-GAN)
- constrained adversarial networks (CANs)
- latent space illumination (LSI)
- Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME)
- a GAN architecture, composed of a branched generator and multiple parallel discriminators
- multi-discriminator GAN
- conditional GAN (cGAN)
- RL as player agent to test against level generator created by GAN
- Evolutionary computation (EC) 
- gradient descent
- evolutionary algorithms such as Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) 
- Deep Learning Novelty Explorer (DeLeNoX)
- latent variable evolution (LVE) 
- Latent Variable approach which combines unsupervised learning in the form of a GAN/VAE with evolutionary computation to search for content in the learned space of a GAN/VAE.
- Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs)
- interactive evolutionary computation (IEC)
- Neuroevolution via novelty search
- Latent semantic features of the content, something for DL to measure statistical measures
- Semantic hashing based on autoencoders, to categorize
- deep player behavior modeling (DPBM)
- multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
- Bayes Net
