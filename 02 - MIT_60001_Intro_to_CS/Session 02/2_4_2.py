#Finger exercise: Write a program that asks the user to input 10 integers, and then prints the largest odd number that was entered. If no odd number was entered, it should print a message to that effect.

entered = 0
nums = []
while (entered is < 10):
    nums[entered] = int (input('Enter a number '))
    entered += 1

#find the one that is the largest odd number

print("the largest odd number is ", biggest)
