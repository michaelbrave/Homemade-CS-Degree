From the course on udemy https://www.udemy.com/godot-beginner-to-advanced-complete-course/

godot has a dedicated 2d renderer
    which means?
        it's not just a 2D plane like in unity
        there is really only the x and y plane 
        better for legitimatly 2d games

nodes can be scenese, different nodes interact with each other
sprite node has a collision node etc


extends Node2d is the library
func _ready is like a main

it loads everything in the scene from top to bottom

process function does something every frame
    have to set the process in the ready func to use

classes are kind of like the man, you can look up functions and read how they work

children and inhertance works in the scene?

get node to code to the object
can use a .func() to pipe it into what you want done


to use the variable in the editor, use export before var,it's kind of like global
