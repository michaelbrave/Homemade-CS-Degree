Definitions:
Generative Art: works of art that rely on an autonomous system for part or all of their production
Computational Creativity: the academic field devoted to the study of computational processes for creative tasks
AKA Metacreation or artificial creativity
Artificial Intelligence is the science of having machines solve problems that do require intelligence when solved by a human
A creative task is a task for which there is no clear best outcomes, which is how it's differnt than rational problems
Computational creativity differs from AI because it does taks with ill defined goals, there is no optimal solution
Study of computational models of human creativity and creative processes, by modeling in computers
artificially creative systems or metacreations, or artifically creative systems, meta creative systems, to produce or simulate creative behavior.
Focus on process and methodologies and test them against human creativity
computaitonal systems for supporting creativity, user interface, interaction design, decision support, data modelling techniques 
Computational creativity is broader in scope than generative art, as not all creative tasks are artistic ones
Generative Art is any practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomoy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art
Generative art doesn't have to be computational and predates computers

but the point of computational creativity is creative processes

Processes as they are
    can we understand creativity?
    if we understand it can we model it?
    if we can model it can we build simulations?

processes as they could be
    things humans can't do without machines, but could have interesting behaviors or outcomes
    what creativity could be


what is useful about computational creativity?
Primarily it is research on the nature of creativity
it pulls tools and techniques from mathematics, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, artificial life and machine learning
linear vs non linear media, single paths like books, multi paths like games or websites
also allows for personalization and adaptation
and helps to keep costs of production doesn

it's also useful for design and ergonomics, Human Computer interaction
for more fluid high level interactions with the machine

societal reasons, like automating labor and information processing
artists aren't afraid of using new tools

cultural and artistic reasons - where artists give away some of their process to formalize and free up their mind for more important tasks

examples of metacreations
Aaron created by howard cohen
using turtle and flatbed devices

Continuator is a musical software agent
that plays with a human musician and learns to play in the same style as the human
it uses midi files to know what the music is playing
uses markov chains
stylistic continuation


types of intelligence
analytic - analyzing, judging, comparing
practical- apply use, put into practice
synthetic - imagine or predict

what is creativity?
it's imaginative or generative
purposeful
original or novel
    rare
    judged as such
    it associates pieces of distant knowledge
valuable


personal creativity vs historical creativity
is it only valuable to the artist or is it valuable to society

exploratory creativity - within a realm of rules
combinatorial - two thigns mashed up
transformational creativity - when the act changes the rules of the games

individual creativity vs group/social creativity
non-human creativity - animals etc
evolution

any process that makes novel and valuable things are creative

dimenstions to characterize creative systems
the domain in which the system operates, and the task it addressses
and broken down into smaller tasks, there are at least 20 tasks for music alone
specific vs generic/scientific
reactive systems vs autonomous
computer assisted creativity or computer support tools
low level interactivity or reactivity - if it takes input in real time
    most art tools today and interactive art today
high level interactivity or agent interaction or conversational interactivity
    two agents interact with each other, like a tango or a conversation 

also the relationship to time
    online vs offline or generated in realtime or ahead of time
origin of systems knowledge
    encoded
    extracted knowledge/corpus based or parametric or data set 
    static vs dynamic

four classes of behavior
    fixed
    periodic
    complex
    chaotic
effective complexity, internal work and external behavior

Architecture of the system
    Generative
    Generate and evaluate 
    gernative with reflexive feedback
    interactive and adaptive

input parameters, self enclosed, that generates new artifacts
but add a reflexive loop that evaluates artificats and it's the second
    quantity breeds quality
    withhold critisim
    welcome wild Ideas
        new perspective
        suspend assumptions
    combine and improve Ideas
interactive or adaptive systems, have a feedback loop with the environement
    can also sense audience or environement

session 2

what about animal made art and ascetics?
    bowerbirds kind of do it
art is about form 
the history of art is about the coevolution between artists and tools
generative art could be as old as geometry or even as old as art itself

we use both 
    fabricated tools, concrete or material
        paints
        brushes
        etc
    intellectual tools
        philosophy
        linguistics
        mathematics
        etc

is it a repeated process or action?

he goes through a timeline of the invention of language, writing etc

communitorial poetry?
reorganize the poem to generate new poems 

musical Negotiation and algorithmic notation 

conceptual advances in mathematics created things
invention of geometry helped a lot
math has always informed math and society
ratios too, for example the golden ratio 
also proportions

science and art are intertwined
then perspective 

then automation
    things like hydralic energy

Automata
    Al-jazari's musical automata 

later mechanical eneargy and steam power
