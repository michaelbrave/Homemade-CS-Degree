//: - Callout(Exercise):
//: Define an enum called `SConfig` representing the different configurations for the 2017 Tesla Model S vehicle. Use a raw type (Double) to represent its starting price in USD. The following image contains the possible configurations:
//:

//: - Callout(Exercise):
//: Define an enum called `XConfig` representing the different configurations for the 2017 Tesla Model X vehicle. Use a raw type (Double) to represent its starting price in USD. The following image contains the possible configurations:
//:
//: ![model-s](/modelX.png)

//: - Callout(Exercise):
//: Define an enum called `ThreeType` representing the different types for the 2017 Tesla 3 vehicle. Use a raw type (Double) to represent its starting price in USD. The following image contains the possible types:
//:
//: ![model-s](/model3.png)

//: - Callout(Exercise):
//: Define an enum called `Tesla2017` representing Tesla's cars for 2017 â€” the Model S, Model X, and Model 3. Each case (car) should have an associated value for the different configuration or type for that model. Create a constant called `newCar` that is a Standard Tesla 2017 Model 3.
//:

//: - Callout(Exercise):
//: Use a switch statement to extract and print the starting the value for `newCar`. The switch statement should be able to handle any type of Tesla 2017 model.
