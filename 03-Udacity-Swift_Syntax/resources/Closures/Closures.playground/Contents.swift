//: # Closures

//: ### Closures include: 
//: __global functions, nested functions, and closure expressions__

//: ### What is a closure expression?
//: closure expression - __an unnamed, self contained block of code that can be passed as an argument to a function__

//: ### What are closure expressions used for?
//: Closure expressions are used to __specify an action to be executed some time in the future.__

//: ## Sorted

var bids = [48.1, 75.4, 63.7, 52.4, 68.2]
var orderedBids = bids.sorted(by: { (bid1: Double, bid2:Double) -> Bool in
    return  bid2 > bid1
})
print(orderedBids)

//: Closures typically take the form:
//:
//: { (parameters) -> return type **in**
//:
//:     statements to execute

//: ### Tricks to make your closures more concise: filter
var examGrades = [81, 99, 54, 84, 98]
var passingGrades = examGrades.filter({(grade: Int) -> Bool in
    return grade > 70
})
passingGrades

//: Inferring closure expression type
var grades = [81, 99, 54, 84, 98]
var failingGrades = examGrades.filter({grade in
    return grade < 70
})

failingGrades

//: Implicit returns
var moreGrades = [81, 99, 54, 84, 98]
var morePassingGrades = examGrades.filter({grade in
    grade > 70
})
morePassingGrades

//: Shorthand argument names: $0, $1, $2 ...
// Example 1
var myGrades = [81, 99, 54, 84, 98]
var myFailingGrades = examGrades.filter({
    $0 < 70
})
myFailingGrades

// Example 2
var soups = ["tomato", "hot and sour", "french onion", "vegetable"]
var alphabeticalSoups = soups.sorted(by: {(soup1: String, soup2: String) -> Bool in
    return soup2 > soup1
})
