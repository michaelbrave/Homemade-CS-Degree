//: ## Lesson 7 Exercises - Enums & Structs

//: __Problem 1__
//:
//: At the end of the code snippet below, what is the value of macchiato.steamedMilk when EspressoDrink is implemented as a struct? What about when EspressoDrink is implemented as a class?
enum Amount {
    case none
    case splash
    case some
    case alot
}

struct EspressoDrink {
    let numberOfShots: Int
    var steamedMilk: Amount
    let foam: Bool

    init(numberOfShots: Int, steamedMilk: Amount, foam: Bool) {
        self.numberOfShots = numberOfShots
        self.steamedMilk = steamedMilk
        self.foam = foam
    }
}

var macchiato = EspressoDrink(numberOfShots: 2, steamedMilk: .none, foam: true)
var espressoForGabrielle = macchiato
espressoForGabrielle.steamedMilk = .splash
macchiato.steamedMilk

// Solution
// if EspressoDrink is a struct, macchiato.steamedMilk == .None
// if EspressoDrink is a class, macchiato.steamedMilk == .Splash

//: __Problem 2__
//:
//: __2a.__
//: Write an enum to represent the five fingers on a human hand.
//:
//: __2b.__
//: Associate an Int value with each finger.
// Solution
enum Finger: Int {
    case thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky
}

//: __Problem 3__
//:
//: Enum, class, or struct?
//:
//: Uncomment the code below and choose whether each type should be an enum, class, or struct.
struct Window {
    let height: Double
    let width: Double
    var open: Bool
}

enum WritingImplement {
    case pen
    case pencil
    case marker
    case crayon
    case chalk
}

struct Material {
    let name: String
    let density: Double
    let stiffness: Double
}

struct Bicycle {
    let frame: Material
    let weight: Double
    let category: String
    
    static var bikeCategories: [String] = ["Road", "Touring", "Mountain", "Commuter", "BMX"]
    
    func lookCool() {
        print("Check out my gear-shifters!")
    }
}

class Cyclist {
    var speed: Double
    let agility: Double
    let bike: Bicycle
    
    var maneuverability: Double {
        get {
            return agility - speed/5
        }
    }
    
    init(speed: Double, agility: Double, bike: Bicycle) {
        self.speed = speed
        self.agility = agility
        self.bike = bike
    }
    
    func brake() {
        speed -= 1
    }
    
    func pedalFaster(_ factor: Double) {
        speed * factor
    }
}

enum Size: String {
    case small = "8 ounces"
    case medium = "12 ounces"
    case large = "16 ounces"
}

//: __Problem 4__
//:
//: Write a cookie struct.
//:
//: __4a.__
//: Include 2 stored properties. Examples might include a string representing flavor, or an int representing minutesSinceRemovalFromOven.

//:__4b.__
//: Add a computed property, "delicious", a bool whose value depends upon the values of the stored properties. 

//:__4c.__
//:Include a method. For example, the method tempt() might return or print out an indication of a person being tempted to eat the cookie.

//: __4d.__
//: Create an instance of your Cookie struct and call its method.

// Example Solution
struct Cookie {
    let flavor: String
    let minutesSinceBaking: Int
    
    var delicious: Bool {
        get {
            if flavor == "Chocolate Chip" || (minutesSinceBaking < 30) {
                return true
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    
    func tempt(){
        if delicious {
            print("I'll just have one more.")
        } else {
            print("I really shouldn't.")
        }
    }
}

//: __Problem 5__
//:
//: Write a class to represent a listing for a Bed and Breakfast.
//:
//: __5a.__
//: Include 3 stored properties. Examples might include a category representing the type of housing i.e. apartment or house, or a bool representing availability. 

//: __5b.__
//: Consider writing a helper enum and incorporating it as one of your properties.

//: __5c.__
//: Include at least one method. For example, the method book() might toggle the availability bool or return a reservation confirmation.

//: __5d.__
//: Create an instance of your BnBListing class and call one of its methods.
// Example Solution
enum Housing {
    case mansion
    case apartment
    case shack
    case house
}

class BnBListing {
    let category: Housing
    let capacity: Int
    var available: Bool
    
    init(category: Housing, price: Int, capacity: Int, available: Bool) {
        self.category = category
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.available = available
    }
    
    func book() {
        self.available = false
        print("Reservation confirmed!")
    }
}

let beachBungalow = BnBListing(category: .shack, price: 20, capacity: 2, available: true)
beachBungalow.book()
beachBungalow.available
