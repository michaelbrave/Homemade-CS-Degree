1. Entity Component Systems (ECS)
1. Data Oriented Design/Coding or Data Driven Design
2. Test Driven Development
3. Multithread code, Parallelisation


Other Types of Development/Design to look into a bit:
- Behavior Driven Design/Development (BDD)
    - Original Post by Dan North
- Domain Driven Design (DDD)
    - Bounded Context
- Event Driven Architecture
- Event Storming
- Entity Component Architecture, Entity Component System, not Entity Component Systems
- Structured Programming (late 60's - 70's)
    - Book by DAHL, Dijkstra, Hoare
    - Robert Floyed - the Paradigms of Programming
    - Dijkstra - Goto statement considered harmful
    - it's more or less control flow applied to procedural, but could have evolved, didn't use concurrency
    - David Gelernter + Nicholas Carriero - Coordination Languages and their significance
    - Coordination + Computation = Programs, small pieces of single threaded code that communicate via queues or constructs
    - Honestly when it touches on Coordination languages, it sounds and aweful lot like Data-Oriented design or functional code to me
    - IO pipelike structure
    - promise and future instead of a mutex
    - book, communicating sequential processes by Hoare
