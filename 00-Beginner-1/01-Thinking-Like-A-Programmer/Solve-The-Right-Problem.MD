i.e. requirements - what problem am I actually trying to solve

- Condition of capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
- condition of capability that must be met or posssessed by a system or system components to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document

it's easy to solve the wrong problem because it's fun or because someone else showed you a solution

Before we implement a solution, what is the problem we are actually trying to solve?

Even advanced engineers struggle with this and improve over thier lives
