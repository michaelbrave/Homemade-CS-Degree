Python For Everybody - https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python
Taught by https://www.dr-chuck.com/ of University of Michigan

This is the most popular Python course and the instructor really cares about mastery in the future


------ Path to Master Programmer
Inspired by this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3o6yEzcnLc 

What he teaches online he refers to as the first half of the path toward a master programmer. The rest he hasn't developed yet and likely would not be approved by a university as it's too different.

1st half of path to master programmer
1. Python
2. Python Data Structures

3. Django - learning objective is actually more Object oriented with examples than it is for web
4. PHP & MYSQL - the non object oriented version of how to write web, more power
5. Postgress - Databases are core skills

2nd half of path to master programmer
1. C programming for everybody - core objective is understand how other layers like Java or python use C to implement OOP
2. Assembly for everybody - zoom into the abstraction
3. Hardware for everybody - zoom into the abstraction
4. Java for everybody

Capstone
1. Internship

- he seems willing to mentor those who have finished the above, but not someone who hasnt

OOP in real world seems to be the holdup, scaleable internships

other things he lists that may help in getting hired
- worked with people, been to meetings
- know what a bug tracker is
- know what a patch is
- know how github works
- know how software is versioned
- know how production works
- have actually used very complex software
- recomends QA as an entry level job

"you don't have to block access to your premium content to make money with content"
"you make money with things like credentials, mentoring, tech support and assistance, open source has taught us that"
"the IP itself is a small part of the value proposition"

"a master programmer can be dropped into 1000 lines of code and within about a month can work with that code"
"not afraid of large code, and can leverage mentors to be useful"

some of the problems of teaching are
1. not giving the why
2. overteaching, giving too much not needed information
3. expecting prereqs of knowledge
4. don't teach how to take a course, or how to learn more

My paraphrasing of what he says
- computer science has been a distaster since 1981
- first round of compsci people started with tinkerers to the point that programming was an afterthought, and it was from diverse disciplines and people
- teaching was like people teaching their hobby, easygoing about it
- basically compsci got ruined by math purists taking over and implementing too much structure, authority and discipline and by taking it too seriously
- Hopper vs Dijkstra (I think I lean toward Hopper's opinions)
- CS1 destroyed computer science - recursion shouldn't be taught till 40 or 50 weeks, not week 7
- solution is to strip the theory for the beginners
- the joke about any company having 20 neckbeards who run everything, those tend to be the more experienced but less educated master programmers, they hire computer scientests because they don't know who else to hire, and they become master programemrs or get fired
- curriculim designed for the curious, ideal for someone who is like 13
- allowing self selection of those who would hunt it out on youtube tends to self remove diversity due to most of them having partents who code
- part of what makes education work at scale is good assments, should learn and not be miserable during assessments
    - autograder frameworks is something he did, and core to his success
- programming is more trade than theory

look into
- google summer of code
- hacker communities
- cisco certificaiton - seems how they do it is pretty good
