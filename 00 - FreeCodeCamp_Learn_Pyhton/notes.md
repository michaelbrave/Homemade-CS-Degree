math stuff is mostly normal
print(str(num)) gotta cast it to print it

abs = absolute value of a number
so if num = -5
abs(num)
would print 5
pow(num, power)
pow(3, 2) = 9
max(4, 6)  pulls out which is the bigger number
min(3, 9) pulls out the smaller number
round(4.2) rounds it

importing
from math import * - this gets all the math functions
floor(3.7) chops off the decimal point
ceil(3.7) rounds up no matter what
sqrt(36)

look up module


input("enter your name")
