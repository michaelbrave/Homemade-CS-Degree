### Steps of compiling

- Preprocessing - includes the header files in compiling, filles out the shorthand
- Compiling - souce code to machine code but more precise, first it turns it into assembly code, then machine code
- Assembling
- Linking

### debugging

always focus on the top error
help50 make programName - to use their compiler help file

syntax errors and logic errors are different
syntax will keep it from compiling, logic will work the way it was supposed to but not the way you wanted.

ctrl + l is the same as clear

use printf to see what's going on
