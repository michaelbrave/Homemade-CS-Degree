Second Course "Designing With Java" Objectives
1. Systematically design programs in the context of a real world language
2. incorporate exising libraries into design
3. implment use of type checking, object oriented programming and the idea of "programming via composition of existing building blocks"
4. main point is to implement design (as learned before) while thinking in oop abstractions
(Book Rough Draft - How to Design Classes https://felleisen.org/matthias/HtDC/htdc.pdf)
(I could likely switch the language to C# and learn the same things if I can just find a course outline)
