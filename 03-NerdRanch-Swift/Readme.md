this is the book "Swift Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" by Matthew Mathias and John Gallagher

This book is older and written for swift 3, so it will not be complete but swift has been somewhat stable since 3 so I'll just have to catch up on the features added later to supplement. I still think this is one of the best books to learn from despite it's age.
