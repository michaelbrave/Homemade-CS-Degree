Preface:

Shows as Fig 1.1 apparently it's the core of thinking about how to design programs, almost like a checklist to reference when one gets stuck on a step. 
Likely the most important part of the book, the distilled wisdom of it in checklist form. I did reword some of it for clarity or simplicity. 

The Steps
1. Problem Analysis & Data Defenitions
    a. Identify information that must be represented
    b. Think about "how is this data represented in this programming language?"
    c. Formulate data definitions
    d. Illustrate with examples
2. Signature, Purpose Statement, Header
    a. State what kind of data the function will use and create
    b. Answer "what does the function compute?"
    c. Define a stub that lives up to the signature (I'm not sure what this means yet, will add later)
3. Function Examples
    a. Work through examples to illustrate the Functions purpose
4. Function Template (this is likely the most important part)
    a. Turn data definitions into an outline of the function
5. Function Defenition (This is the creative part)
    a. Fill in the gaps in the function template
    b. Use a purpose statement and examples
6. Testing
    a. Articulate examples and tests, pass all of those tests and examples
    b. If tests don't pass fix mistakes and repeat until it passes all tests
    c. Tests help to supplement examples to aid in future understanding
7. Bonus - Iterative Refinement
    a. Simplify by removing all the unneeded parts. Do it all over but smarter this time using what was learned
    b. Get user (and developer?) feedback, then refine again based on that feedback. 
    c. Repeat until satisfied

Simplified Steps
1. Analyze a problem statment - usually looks like a math word problem
2. Extract and express it's essence, using abstration
3. Illustrate the essence with examples
4. Make outlines and plans based on Analysis
5. Evaluate results compared to expected outcomes
6. Revise based on failed checks and tests
7. Bonus - Simplify and Iterate based on what's been learned
