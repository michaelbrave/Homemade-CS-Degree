Personal Notes from:

The Book "Brining Desing to Software" by Terry Winograd
ACM-Press (1996)
ISBN - 0-201-85491-0
QA76.76.D47B745 1996

Reasoning:
Someone referenced a manifesto at the start of this book during a talk advocating design of software as a discipline. I thought the quote was fascinating so I looked up the manifesto and saw it was printed in this book and that the book also had a collection of other articles dedicated toward the idea of software design as a practice and was fascinated so I bough it for about $6 online (it's an old book). I figued my notes from it could be supplmentary toward my studies of HtDP and so will include them here. 

I come from a background as a designer, and I've always felt that good software could be designed via a process, something almost like a checklist, which I've found is actually taught in HtDP (although this does dip a bit into software achitecture it's not quite the same). Other than that and maybe a handful of talks on youtube I've not found many others who feel as I do. But when I found this book, and saw that it was older and more that the initial manifesto that lead me to it was older still as this was a reprint of that article, I really wanted to not only learn this history of this movment (lacking a better word) but also to see some of the thoughts of my previous kindred spirits. Those that are still alive I may try to look them up, maybe even start a podcast or youtube channel that foucuses on this depending on what I find here.
