Courses about AI, Machine Learning, & other types of AI with a focus on generating content. 


Things to Look up / Terms - especially in context of generating content:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Deep Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    - mostly used for time-dependent sequential data (e.g., action sequences, agent paths, charts for rhythm)
    - Contextual Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (C-BLSTM)
- Deep Learning - defined as neural networks with at least two layers and some nonlinearity
- Reinforcement Learning
- Transformers (like GPT-3)
- Language Models
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    - good for images
- Supervised Learning (SL)
    - used as a predictor or quality evaluator or preference screener
- Unsupervised Learning (USL)
- Autoencoders
    - Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
        - NPC role classifier
    - Gaussian Mixture VAE
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    - communication systems
- Knowledge Graph
- stochastic bi-objective beam search model
    - to identify emotion
- Markov Decision Process (MDP)
