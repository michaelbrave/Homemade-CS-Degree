# Homemade-CS-Degree

This Started as a way for me to fill in my gaps of knowledge about programming (as I do want to achieve some level of mastery with it). But it soon evolved into a place where I kept my notes, reviewed courses and eventually turned into how I would design a curriculim for others in the future using resources recommended to me and by me. 

Eventually I'll use these notes and experiences to help me design my own classes and books.

Nothing has ended up on this list without at least being strongly recommended, as I go through them I will consolidate and only leave what I felt was the best, so it will get cleaner and clearer with time. Think of it as a possibility space, like a library full of books yet to be read, a hope and a direction that will narrow over time leaving behind what was found to have quality.

---------- Influences & Reasoning ----------

-------- First School to Influence My Curriculim Choices is 42, which was based on Epitech -------
--- Things that worked well ---
1. Project based (this was huge, and incredible)
2. Figure it out Philosophy (this relies on projects being introduced in an appropriate order, to build on knowledge)
3. Peer Teaching/Learning
4. Automatic testing/grading
5. Branching Path Specialization, and visualizing it in circles as they did with the Holy Graph was a good way to implement elective projects and prereqs
6. I did feel that it helped to prepare me for an internship, especially the ability to figure things out on my own

--- Things I Would Change ---
1. Having some kind of mentor/teacher to ask questions of, or even hints about what to study next would have helped a lot
2. There was a constant stress caused by concerns that you may miss a deadline and get kicked out, semester and course like timelines could have alleviated this
3. Lack of organizational hierarchy sounded good on paper but just caused problems
4. The open floor plan wasn't the worst, but I would have set up more quiet zones, or semi private areas


-------- Second Influence My Curriculim Choices is SICP & HtDP --------
I started with HtDP since both were designed for beginners (Kinda) but SICP relies a lot on linear Algebra knowledge, which I haven't learned yet. So I felt that HtDP should be treated as mroe foundational with SICP as being closer to inermediate. 

The book (HtDP) was designed to be a part 1 of a 4-5 course series taught at Northeaster University
1. How to Design Programs (Fundamentals 1)
2. Designing with Java (Fundamentals 2)
3. Logic in Computer Science (Reasoning About Well-Designed Code)
4. Object-Oriented Design (Scaling up)
5. Software Development (Putting it all together)
(Most of these are meant to be done with pair programming and peer reviews)

Discrete Mathematics should also be included
How to prove programs should also be included
--

First Course "How to Design Programs" Objective
1. Learn systemic and explicit design of programs
2. Learn how to do systemic problem solving
3. Understand the complexities of creating well-engineered software
4. it uses a stripped down lisp (BSL beginner student language) to allow for smaller errors and less steep of a learning curve while also not worrying about environment and syntax concerns as much as one would with a standard language. This is closely tied to the IDE (DrRacket or just Racket nowadays), and the concepts of design are much easier to understand without the frustrations that would come wihout using both of these tools. 
(part of this book touches on OOP and I kind of want to dive deeper into functional before moving onto that, so I may break to learn haskell a bit before completing)

Online Course: https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-complex-data

A Bridge between the two classes?
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4713v2

Second Course "Designing With Java" Objectives
1. Systematically design programs in the context of a real world language
2. incorporate exising libraries into design
3. implment use of type checking, object oriented programming and the idea of "programming via composition of existing building blocks"
4. main point is to implement design (as learned before) while thinking in oop abstractions
(Book Rough Draft - How to Design Classes https://felleisen.org/matthias/HtDC/htdc.pdf)
(I could likely switch the language to C# and learn the same things if I can just find a course outline)

Link: https://web.archive.org/web/20201210204853/https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2510/index.html 
--

Third Course "Logic in Computer Science" Objectives
1. make reasoning about programs explicit
    a. (propositional and first-order) logic
    b. heavily emphasizing structural induction as a proof method for establishing theorems about functions and programs
2. introduce students to tools that assist with this
    a. ACL2 - a proof assistant (there are others?)

Link: https://web.archive.org/web/20190428201834/https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2800/index.html
--

Fourth Course "Object-Oriented Design" Objectives
1. Scaling up of complexity of programs
2. Designing and "Glueing" components
3. Interfaces and checking (I think)
4. Presenting to large groups
(I believe I have a rough draft of this book in pdf form somewhere, will add to repository later)

Link: https://web.archive.org/web/20210415162303/https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs3500/#%28part._info%29
--

Fifth Course " Software Development" Objectives
1. Maintenance of Code
2. Why design matters, why logical reasoning matters, why people skills matter
3. Designing/Coding in Parts to Assemble Later and understand the weaknesses of the initial design
4. Fixing code from weeks ago - fixing bugs, adding features, replacing features, subtracting features, commenting better
5. IBM's white room code review process

Link: https://web.archive.org/web/20200219190302/http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4500-f18/index.html 
--

Things that are missing and could be supplemented
1. Independant projects and exploration (I have many so no worries)
2. How to use a performance debugger to identify hotspots
3. How to Analyze hotspots and their surroundings
4. How to create alternate solutions
5. How to set up relevant performance test suites to easily compare different solutions
6. Programming Safety - seg faults, core dumps, overflows etc
7. Testing
8. Team based programming
9. Software Modeling/mapping/blueprints (like software architecture?)
    a. Recomended Expert - Daniel Jackson https://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/talks/ 
    b. Recomended Expert - Emina Torlak https://emina.github.io/kodkod/pubs.html 

Recomended Reading
1. https://felleisen.org/matthias/Thoughts/Developing_Developers.html 



-------- Third Influence My Curriculim Choices is Dr Chuck's "Path to Mastery" --------
--- Path to Master Programmer ---
Inspired by Dr Chuck (Charles Severance) as he spoke about it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3o6yEzcnLc 

-- 1st half of path to master programmer --
1. Python For Everybody
2. Python Data Structures 
3. Django For Everybody - learning objective is actually more Object oriented with examples than it is for web
4. PHP & MYSQL - the non object oriented version of how to write web, more power
5. Postgress - Databases are core skills

-- 2nd half of path to master programmer - not yet developed, on your own to figure it out --
1. C programming for everybody - core objective is understand how other layers like Java or python use C to implement OOP
2. Assembly for everybody - zoom into the abstraction
3. Hardware for everybody - zoom into the abstraction
4. Java for everybody

Capstone
1. Internship - focus on OOP in the real world


--- Other things he says may help in getting hired ---
- worked with people, been to meetings
- know what a bug tracker is
- know what a patch is
- know how github works
- know how software is versioned
- know how production works
- have actually used very complex software
- recomends QA as an entry level job


--- Some of the problems of other courses or teachings are ---
1. not giving the why
2. overteaching, giving too much not needed information
3. expecting prereqs of knowledge
4. don't teach how to take a course, or how to learn more


My paraphrasing of what he said
- computer science has been a distaster since 1981
- first round of compsci people started with tinkerers to the point that programming was an afterthought, and it was from diverse disciplines and people
- teaching was like people teaching their hobby, easygoing about it
- basically compsci got ruined by math purists taking over and implementing too much structure, authority and discipline and by taking it too seriously
- Hopper vs Dijkstra (I think I lean toward Hopper's opinions)
- CS1 destroyed computer science - recursion shouldn't be taught till 40 or 50 weeks, not week 7
- solution is to strip the theory for the beginners
- the joke about any company having 20 neckbeards who run everything, those tend to be the more experienced but less educated master programmers, they hire computer scientests because they don't know who else to hire, and they grow to become master programemrs or get fired
- curriculim designed for the curious, ideal for someone who is like 13 (he seems to really emphasise teaching teenagers)
- allowing self selection of those who would hunt it out on youtube tends to self remove diversity due to most of them having partents who code
- part of what makes education work at scale is good assments, should learn and not be miserable during assessments
    - autograder frameworks is something he did, and core to his success
- programming is more trade than theory
