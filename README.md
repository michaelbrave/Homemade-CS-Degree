# Homemade-CS-Degree

This Started as a way for me to fill in my gaps of knowledge about programming (as I do want to achieve some level of mastery with it). But it soon evolved into a place where I kept my notes, reviewed courses and eventually turned into how I would design a curriculim for others in the future using resources recommended to me and by me. 

Eventually I'll use these notes and experiences to help me design my own classes and books.

Nothing has ended up on this list without at least being strongly recommended, as I go through them I will consolidate and only leave what I felt was the best, so it will get cleaner and clearer with time. Think of it as a possibility space, like a library full of books yet to be read, a hope and a direction that will narrow over time leaving behind what was found to have quality. 

I've basically decided on 5 curriculim tracks based on what kind of programmer one wants to become.

--- Hacker / Programming for Everyone Track ---
The first track, which I will call the "Hacker Track" is based around the idea that everyone can and should code, and that we should then use it in practical applications of our lives. This track is primarily inspired by "Dr Chuck's Path to Mastery" which is built largely around the University of Michigan's courses with supplemental courses from Harvey Mudd and other gaps filled with what is available until something better is found. 


--- Tech Startup Track ---

--- Code Craftsman / Code Engineer Track ---

--- Programming Wizard Track ---

--- Supplemental Courses/Books ---

--- Self Learning By 42's Projects Track ---


--- Math Courses/Books ---


--- AI & Data Science Related Courses ---
