# Homemade-CS-Degree

This is my attempt to fill in some of the gaps in knowledge that I may have due to being more of a self taught developer (learning at 42 is more of a figure things out yourself style).  

So I've chosen various courses, classes and reading to supplment my gaps in knowledge. Here I will keep references and notes to all of them.  

The first course will be MIT's 6.0001 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python  
This is the course that replaced SICP, which I plan on doing later so that I can compare them(Also I had started with SICP but found my knowledge lacking enough that it felt beyond me, although this was almost a year ago and I would likely do better now, my hope is that this course may help bridge the gap somewhat). This was not only to build up some possibly missing foundational knowledge but also to learn python in preparation for a hackathon in the upcoming month. It was a two birds with one stone choice.
