# Homemade-CS-Degree

This is my attempt to fill in some of the gaps in knowledge that I may have due to being more of a self taught developer (even learning at 42 was more of a figure things out yourself style).  

So I've chosen various courses, classes and reading that will serve that purpose. This repository will keep references, notes, examples and code samples of these resources.  

other courses recomended to me:
- MIT's 6.0001 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

Making a Course List Structure for Others:

With a focus of building a more solid foundation I would do it differently than I learned.
This is a work in progress

If I were to start over, or begin teaching others I would do it in this order:


Beginner Courses:
1. How to Design Programs, Specifically How to Code: Simple Data on Edx "UBCx HtC1x"
    - https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home
2. Python For Everybody
3. CS50

Even though all 3 are beginner Courses I feel like all 3 should give a solid foundation


Beginner 2 Courses:
1. 42 Piscine - to learn all the other stuff missed, like shell, bash, deeper workings of Unix-Like-OS and C, also it being project based and how to figure things out yourself.
2. Discrete Math or Math for Computer Science
3. Django for Everybody - To Learn OOP in context of projects
4. How to Code Complex Data 
    - https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-complex-data
5. Design of Computer Programs by Peter Norvig

With this one would Know C, Python, Java and Racket and would have a pretty solid Foundaiton, Know OOP, Software Design and will have a functional style foundation from their time with Racket. This alone would make someone a better programmer than most.


Intermediate Courses:
1. 42 first 5 Projects until PrintF
2. Math up to Linear Algebra
3. Data Structures and Algorithms
4. Computer Science Logic - If I can find a Course
5. Databases - likely Postgress


Advanced:
1. Assembly
2. Hardware
