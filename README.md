# Homemade-CS-Degree

This is my attempt to fill in some of the gaps in knowledge that I may have due to being more of a self taught developer (even learning at 42 was more of a figure things out yourself style).  

Treat this respository as one would a library of things they want to read and filled with notes of what has been read (in many cases in the hopes of turning it into some sort of learning material for others later). It is as much aspirational as educational, and at the very least serves as a reference for myself so I do not forget.

So I've chosen various courses, classes and reading that will serve that purpose. This repository will keep references, notes, examples and code samples of these resources.  

- Other things to Learn:
    * Iteration  
    * Recursion  
    * Multi Dimentional Arrays + Matrices  
    * Linked Lists  
    * Queues + Stacks + Heaps  
    * Sets + Hash Maps (Very Useful)  
    * Trees + Binary Search  
    * Graphs + Graph Traversals (Depth First Search + Breadth First Search + Backtracking)  
    * Tries  
    * Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort + Quick Sort)  
    * Implementation and Time and Space Complexity Analysis  
    * Dynamic Programming Problems (Memoization + Divide & Conquer)  
    * Proofs (Contrapositive + Contradiction + Cases + Induction)  
    * Multiple Pointers  
    * Sliding Windows  
    * Greedy Algorithms  
    * Object Oriented Programming

Making a Course List Structure for Others:

This is a work in progress

With a focus of building a more solid foundation I would do it differently than I learned.
If I were to start over, or begin teaching others I would do it in this order:

Beginner Courses:
1. How to Design Programs, Specifically How to Code: Simple Data on Edx "UBCx HtC1x"
    - https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home
2. Python For Everybody
3. CS50

Even though all 3 are beginner Courses I feel like all 3 would give a solid foundation, they are listed in order I would assign them.


Beginner 2 Courses:
1. 42 Piscine Projects, 2 Weeks- to learn all the other stuff missed, like shell, bash, deeper workings of Unix-Like-OS and C, also it being project based and how to figure things out yourself.
2. Discrete Math or Math for Computer Science
3. Django for Everybody - To Learn OOP in context of projects
4. Design of Computer Programs by Peter Norvig (Recap of How to Design Programs but harder and in Python)
5. How to Code Complex Data (Part 2 of How to Design Programs)
    - https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-complex-data


With this one would Know C, Python, Java and Racket and would have a pretty solid Foundaiton, Know OOP, Software Design and will have a functional style foundation from their time with Racket. This alone would make someone a better programmer than most.


Intermediate Courses:
1. 42 first 5 Projects until PrintF
2. Math up to Linear Algebra
3. Data Structures and Algorithms
4. Computer Science Logic - If I can find a Course
5. Databases - likely Postgress


Advanced:
1. Assembly
2. Hardware
