# Homemade-CS-Degree

This is my attempt to fill in some of the gaps in knowledge that I may have due to being more of a self taught developer (even learning at 42 was more of a figure things out yourself style).  

So I've chosen various courses, classes and reading that will serve that purpose. This repository will keep references, notes, examples and code samples of these resources.  

other courses recomended to me:
