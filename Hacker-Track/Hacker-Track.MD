The influence for this comes primarily from the University of Michigan (Dr. Chuck) and supplemented heavily from Harvey Mudd.

Ideal for beginners, people with careers that want to learn to code (just stop once you know enough), or those who want to be a web developer.

This Track is based around the philosophies of "everyone can code" and "programming for everyone" with an emphasis on practical application of knowledge.
It starts broad with high level coding, moves toward practical application, then gets into progressively lower level code to understand how the higher level code works internally. It goes in with the understanding that you will learn infinately more on the job eventually, but one should build up their foundation still. But the core idea is that it should be useful and fun and should pique the curiosity to dig deeper.

-------- Primary Influence of These Curriculim Choices is Dr Chuck's "Path to Mastery" --------
--- Path to Master Programmer ---
Inspired by Dr Chuck (Charles Severance) as he spoke about it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3o6yEzcnLc 

-- 1st half of path to master programmer --
1. Python For Everybody
2. Python Data Structures 
3. Django For Everybody - learning objective is actually more Object oriented with examples than it is for web
4. PHP & MYSQL - the non object oriented version of how to write web, more power
5. Postgress - Databases are core skills

-- 2nd half of path to master programmer - not yet developed, on your own to figure it out --
1. C programming for everybody - core objective is understand how other layers like Java or python use C to implement OOP
2. Assembly for everybody - zoom into the abstraction
3. Hardware for everybody - zoom into the abstraction
4. Java for everybody

Capstone
1. Internship - focus on OOP in the real world


--- Other things he says may help in getting hired ---
- worked with people, been to meetings
- know what a bug tracker is
- know what a patch is
- know how github works
- know how software is versioned
- know how production works
- have actually used very complex software
- recomends QA as an entry level job


--- Some of the problems of other courses or teachings are ---
1. not giving the why
2. overteaching, giving too much not needed information
3. expecting prereqs of knowledge
4. don't teach how to take a course, or how to learn more


My paraphrasing of what he said
- computer science has been a distaster since 1981
- first round of compsci people started with tinkerers to the point that programming was an afterthought, and it was from diverse disciplines and people
- teaching was like people teaching their hobby, easygoing about it
- basically compsci got ruined by math purists taking over and implementing too much structure, authority and discipline and by taking it too seriously
- Hopper vs Dijkstra (I think I lean toward Hopper's opinions, which was more hacker culture as opposed to math culture)
- CS1 destroyed computer science - recursion shouldn't be taught till 40 or 50 weeks, not week 7
- solution is to strip the theory for the beginners
- the joke about any company having 20 neckbeards who run everything, those tend to be the more experienced but less educated master programmers, they hire computer scientests because they don't know who else to hire, and they either grow to become master programemrs or get fired
- curriculim designed for the curious, ideal for someone who is like 13 (he seems to really emphasise teaching teenagers)
- allowing self selection of those who would hunt it out on youtube tends to self remove diversity due to most of them having parents who code
- part of what makes education work at scale is good assments, should learn and not be miserable during assessments
    - autograder frameworks is something he did, and core to his success
- programming is more trade than theory
