This is the most popular Python course and the instructor really cares about mastery in the future

core features - not math heavy

----- Notes


Why Program?
- computers are built to do things for us
- but we haave to speak their language
- users get to use prebuilt instructions/programs

programmers anticipate needs
- people buy apps to meet those needs

users see computers
- as a set of tools
- programmers make tools, somtimes using tools to make tools

why be a programmer
- to fix things, make custom things, to solve problems
- it's a good job
- make software to solve your own problems

learn to see things from the inside the computer outward
- how to make things that solve other peoples problems
- understanding the hardware, networks, information, data, software
- mediate for the user

what is code?
- a sequence of instructions in a way to solve a problem for the user
- sometimes art (like UX or pretty code as performance for others)

there are programs for computers and programs for humans

Benefits
- it's scaleable, especially for repetetive stuff


Basic Hardware understanding

CPU is tied closely with main memory, but can offload to secondary memory
input and output devices send instructions to CPU and main memory marriage
most of what you do lives in the main memory
the code you write isn't directly interpreted by the processor, but rather machine laguage turned into binary


--- Python as a language

the design of python was always that it should be powerful, approachable and fun (it was named after monty python after all)
