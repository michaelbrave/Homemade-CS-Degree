-------- Influence of These Curriculim Choices is 42, which was based on Epitech -------

I attended 42 Silicon Valley (when it existed) for a little over a year, and was nearly on track to start my career when Covid happened and the school was shut down. What we learned and how we learned was incredible, an irreplacable experience. I would be remiss to not include it here alongside my other learning paths. Caveat is that there were more than just algorithms and graphics branches but I didn't care enough about those paths to have saved the materials, I appologize that I was short sighted in this, I never imagined the school would close as it did. 

--- Things that worked well ---
1. Project based (this was huge, and incredible)
2. Figure it out Philosophy (this relies on projects being introduced in an appropriate order, to build on knowledge)
3. Peer Teaching/Learning
4. Automatic testing/grading
5. Branching Path Specialization, and visualizing it in circles as they did with the Holy Graph was a good way to implement elective projects and prereqs
6. I did feel that it helped to prepare me for an internship, especially the ability to figure things out on my own

--- Things I Would Change ---
1. Having some kind of mentor/teacher to ask questions of, or even hints about what to study next would have helped a lot
2. There was a constant stress caused by concerns that you may miss a deadline and get kicked out, semester and course like timelines could have alleviated this
3. Lack of organizational hierarchy sounded good on paper but just caused problems
4. The open floor plan wasn't the worst, but I would have set up more quiet zones, or semi private areas
