sketching with code - create a program with one piece at a time

your canvas by default is only 100px wide

first arguments is x position of drawing (verticle center)
second is y (horizonatl center)
third is width
fourth is height

Commands to Know
ellipse - circle
rect - rectangle
line
strokeWeight - for thickness of lines
fill - to fill a thing with color
noFill - for if you want just the lines
stroke - for color
noStroke - for no stroke
createCanvas(1024,768) width, height
background 
beginshape
triangle

beginshape - lets it know that  from now on use these points
vertex - two points in space, link them together to make shapes
endshape - end command for the shape 

everything has fill and stroke too
a lot of this is just getting used to using a grid

largest value 1025, 768

color is a range of 0-255
for RGB we gotta do a red value a green value and a blue value
it looks like 3 arguments   
background(255, 0, 0)

things you make like fill and stroke, the things below will inherit them natively
if you set a fourth value to fill it affects transparency
alpha channel, it's the 4th value listed
same as before, between 0 and 255
if black and white, use just two ranges


nostroke and nofill don't seem to affect everything later like other things
they seem to affect just the immediate calls
