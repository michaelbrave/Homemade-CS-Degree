//: ### A Generic Type
//: - Callout(Exercise):
//: Define a generic type (a class) called `IntAnalyzer` that specifies a single generic type parameter that must implement the `BinaryInteger` protocol. The generic type parameter should be used to define a property called `value`. You must also define an  initializer which sets the `value` property.
//:

//: - Callout(Exercise):
//: Extend `IntAnalyzer` so that it includes a function called `analyze` which prints the value property, its bit width (`value.bitWidth`), and its sign (`value.signum()`).
//:

//: - Callout(Exercise):
//: Create an instance of `IntAnalyzer`, then call the `analyze` function.
