Data science is a creative discipline.
because you are working creativly with data
there is always more than one way to solve a problem or gain an insight.

everything signifies and can give you further insight. 

demand for data science
rare qualities and high demand 

Data Science: 
coding, math and statistics in applied settings. 
analysis of diverse data 
inclusive analysis 

take unstructured data and find order, meaning and value
also provides insight and competative advantage 

data science: intersection of coding, stats, domain expertise (understanding the field)

usually will learn R & Python (maybe julia, swift or c++ too)
learn sql
learn bash
learn regex

math
-probability
-algebra
-regression

understand the domain
-goals, methods and constraints
-can be implemented well

machine learning, traditional research, danger zone?

machine learning = black box model
-coding and math without domain expertise

research is:
math and domain knowledge without coding
-data is structured
- effort is in method and interpretation of data

danger zone is coding and domain knowledge without math
- word counts, maps

most common is a programming background who can do math, stats and business
but other entry points exist.
diverse skills needed
many roles involved.


planning
- define the goals
- organize resources
- coordinate people
- schedule project
data prep
- get data
- clean data (the big part)
- explore data
- refine data
modeling
- create the statistical model (like regression analysis)
- validate the model
- evaluate the model
- refine the model
follow up
- present the insights with others present model
- deploy the model, give it a go
- revisit the model, sometimes things change, check up on it
- archive assets, document what you have, try to make it repeatable or to build off it 

it's not just technical
contextual skills matter too
one step at a time, so that there is less backtracking

19:45

Engineer
-Focus on back end hardware (like servers)
-make data science possible
-developers or database managers

Big Data
-Focus on computer science and math
-Machien Learning
-create data products (recomendation engines)

Researchers
-focus on domain specific research
-physics, genetics
-strong in stats

Analyst
-Day to day tasks of running a business
-Web Analytics, sql
-good for business
-not quite a data scientist since data is structured already?

Business people
-frame business relevant questions
-manage projects
-need to know enough to speak "data"

Entrepreneurs
-data startup
-needs data and business skills
-need to be creative

Full stack unicorn
-mythical creature with magical abilities
-mythical individual with universal abilities
-probably don't exist

different skills and goals for the different roles
usually work in different contexts
but they all use data science making it a richer field

teams in data science
usually experts in different tools

five things need to happen, usually it takes a team to achieve all
coding
stats
graphics
business
projects

you usually can't do data science on your own

28:00

big data = volume, velocity, variety of data

cross big data with data science to make big data science

if it doesn't fit into a machine, it's big data

-machine learning and word counts do not require data science
-but you will need to code and quant

but the definitions get kind of messy

big data isn't data science, they are related but not the same.

coding
-task instructions
-like a recipe
-input and output

coding and data
-word counts, simple
-to make sense of it you need stats, which is data science

data science isn't coding, but they do share things
stats is what seperates the two

data science isn't just a subset of statistics
most data scientists are not formally trained in statistics
machine learning and big data aren't a part of stats
work in different contexts too
-they both analyze data
-but are ecologically distinct
-different backgrounds
-different goals and contexts

it's also not business intelligence
-data on internal operations
-make justifyable decisions
- it doesn't really use coding, premade apps
- usually simple statistics
-focus is on domain expertise and utility
-data dashboards, most are well designed and you can learn a lot about accessibility and design from looking at them

-identify data sources and set up framework
-help past easy questions and data
-can learn good design from BI

-it's very goal oriented, related to data science but not the same


42:00

Etnical issues - do no harm

sources not intended for sharing

anonymity
-not hard to identify a person with a small amount of data
-not identify people uniquely
-proprietary data

copyright
-scraping data is common and useful
-check copyright first

data security
-data is valuable, people may try to steal it, especially if not made anonymous

potential bias
-algos are only as neutral as the rules and data that they get

overconfidence
-analyses are simplifications, still need humans in the loop to check it
-requires humility

potentials and risks
- it can't be neutral
-good judgement is vital

48:40

Methods

tech is the means, insight is the goal

sourcing data
-how to get the data that goes into data science

coding

math

stats

machine learning
-finding clusters or scores that could lead to meaning

tech is just a means to the insight


sourcing -raw materials
-existing data
    -in house
    -open
    -third party
-apis
    -most common way to get web data
    -direct import
-scraping
    -for when they don't have an API
-making data
    -interviews
    -surveys
    -expiraments

GIGO - garbage in, garbage out

Business Metrics
KPI's
Smart Goals
Classification Accurracy

check quality of data and meaning
