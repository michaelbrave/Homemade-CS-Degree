Mostly Stanford, and Harvard, Some MIT

Ideal for career minded individuals, especially those who would work for large software companies or those who would start their own startups. 

Enough to get the job done but based on solid understanding and principles, also approaches it with the idea that teams, leadership and collaboration are involved. Starts from a mid level Language like C and focuses on practical application.
