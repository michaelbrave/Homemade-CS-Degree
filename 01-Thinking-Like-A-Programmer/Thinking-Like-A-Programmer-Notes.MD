Talk - How to Begin Thinking Like a Programmer by Andy Harris
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcrPFhaY9k

Actually more of a talk on how to teach programming to beginners, what they trip up on and how to get around that

My Paraphrasing
- Computers are as dumb as a Rock, this is important to remember
- Learning to Program is Hard, I still feel like an Idiot all the time
    - Languages are Scary (intimidating)
    - Environments are Scary (Intimidating)
    - The People are Scary
    - Most Beginners Have Failed, even smart people that aren't used to failing
    - It's easy to get bad advice
    - Good programmers even if good people are not good teachers
- Bad Beginner Advice
    - Just start with a simple game
    - like tetris
    - start with c++ that's what they use in the industry
        - you will feel stupid in the first 15 seconds
    - Visual Basic, you don't have to code till the end
    - pick a problem you want to solve, often too large of a goal
    - you'll stay motivated if you work on a real world problem, until you feel like an idiot and leave
- What I wish I'd been taught
    - programming is not about languages
    - The language ultimately doesn't matter that much
    - learning the syntax isn't the hard part, the paradigm shifts is the hard part
    - There isn't a lot of memorizing
    - Most programming isn't about math (but gaming, data science and a few specific other areas do use it)
    - You hated math class, I'm not sure you've actually met math
    - The kind of thinking your doing is the kind of thinking math was trying to teach you anyway
    - programming languages are simpler than human ones
    - programming is really about solving problems
    - it's about explaining things to the idiot computer
- Code isn't about language
    - coding has only about 8 main concepts, work almost the same accross languages, you notice this after learning about language 4 or 5
    - learn how to use these concepts in english
    - write out the conecepts first, then convert to code later - if you are lot it's because you shouldn't be coding yet
    - Most beginners think they don't unserstand what code to write, but actually they don't udnerstand the problem they are trying to solve, experts do that too
- Comments are Code
    - comments explain code to other programers
    - code explains the comments to the computer? - flip the order, write the comment first the look up what you need to look up until you get it, then write the code
- Any time you make a variable
    - what's it's name
    - what's it's type
    - what's it's starting value
- Output
    - message, text to write to user
- intput - ask the user message and store the user variable
    - variable, where answer from user will be stored
    - message/prompt, question being asked of user
- these sometimes seem so simple that it seems like arrogance to beginners, but we just forgot that it wasn't obvious at first
- beginners should write this out in pseudo code, it feels slow to us but it's important for beginners, then convert into comments
- then flesh out the comments into code, one line at a time
- embrace failure, debug, did you tell it to do it incorrectly, or did you tell it to do the wrong thing
- How to Debug
    - Ideally prevent bugs
    - bad implementation can be googled
    - bad algorithms usually can't be googled
    - what part are you not understanding?
    - what tools can you use?
    - Don't start with a solution
    - start by truly understanding the problem
- While Loop
    - sentry, variable that will control loop
    - initialization code, code that initializes sentry
    - condition, loop repeats if condition is true
    - chagne code, code to cahnge sentry so condition can be triggered
    - while loops imply a lot that isn't required, which is why so much goes wrong with them
- For Loop
    - sentry, integer variable taht will control loop
    - start, integer value of sentry at beginning (how is this different from intialization?)
    - finish, integer value of sentry at end
    - change, integer to add sentry at each pass
    - what about iterators (python)?
    - he teaches for loops before while loops
- Other Concepts to Teach Later
    - Lists and Tuples
    - String Manipulation
    - Working with Built-in Help
    - List Iterations
    - Functions and scope and parameters and return
    - Objects
