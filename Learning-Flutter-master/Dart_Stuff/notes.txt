what is the dom?
0.41
we will have to convert to javascript

maps? dictionary in C#, literal objects from javascript?

~/ divide without remainder
is!/is/as - casting and type testing
identical function?
.. - cascade operator, lets you append onto things like maps or variables

metafunctions, I don't understand?
String meta(Function theFunction(String Name)) {
    print(theFunction('meta'));
}

=> shorthand syntax, not quite the same as lambda in C#

//conditionals and switches
//allow a default case
//all case statements require break or jump statement
//there can be an empty case where it can fall through
//look up switch cases

switch (name) {
  case "Tom":
  case "Bob":
    print("yo!");
    break;
    
  default:
    print("Hi");
}


look up iteration loops (for each loops)

look up classes and constructors

what the hell are generics?
